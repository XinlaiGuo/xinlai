# ## 1. Pick one of the datasets from the ChatBot session(s) of the TUT demo (or from your own ChatBot session if you wish) and use the code produced through the ChatBot interactions to import the data and confirm that the dataset has missing values

# In[4]:


import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.isna().sum()


# ## 2. Start a new ChatBot session with an initial prompt introducing the dataset you're using and request help to determine how many columns and rows of data a pandas DataFrame has, and then

# #### 1 use code provided in your ChatBot session to print out the number of rows and columns of the dataset; and,

# In[6]:


# Get the shape of the DataFrame
df_shape = df.shape
print(f"The dataset has {df_shape[0]} rows and {df_shape[1]} columns.")


# In[7]:


# Get the column names
columns = df.columns
print("The columns in the dataset are:")
print(columns)


# #### 2 write your own general definitions of the meaning of "observations" and "variables" based on asking the ChatBot to explain these terms in the context of your dataset

# This is my explanation, the observation is every row in the dataset, it is more individual, and the variable is more like the type of different data in the dataset, so it is called the column.

# ## 3. Ask the ChatBot how you can provide simple summaries of the columns in the dataset and use the suggested code to provide these summaries for your dataset

# In[9]:


# Summary statistics for numerical columns
numerical_summary = df.describe()
print("Summary statistics for numerical columns:")
print(numerical_summary)


# In[10]:


# Summary statistics for categorical columns
categorical_summary = df.describe(include=['object'])
print("Summary statistics for categorical columns:")
print(categorical_summary)


# In[11]:


# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# In[12]:


# Get data types of each column
data_types = df.dtypes
print("Data types of each column:")
print(data_types)


# In[13]:


# View the first few rows of the dataset
sample_data = df.head()
print("Sample data from the dataset:")
print(sample_data)


# ## 4. If the dataset you're using has (a) non-numeric variables and (b) missing values in numeric variables, explain (perhaps using help from a ChatBot if needed) the discrepancies between size of the dataset given by df.shape and what is reported by df.describe() with respect to (a) the number of columns it analyzes and (b) the values it reports in the "count" column

# Let's use the Titanic dataset from the provided link to explain the discrepancies between the dataset size reported by df.shape and the statistics reported by df.describe().

# In[14]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[15]:


# Get the shape of the DataFrame
df_shape = df.shape
print(f"The dataset has {df_shape[0]} rows and {df_shape[1]} columns.")


# In[16]:


# Summary statistics for numerical columns
numerical_summary = df.describe()
print("Summary statistics for numerical columns:")
print(numerical_summary)

# Summary statistics for all columns (including non-numeric)
all_summary = df.describe(include='all')
print("Summary statistics for all columns:")
print(all_summary)


# In[17]:


# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# Explanation of Discrepancies

# Number of Columns Analyzed:
# 
# df.shape:
# 
# This will give you the total number of rows and columns in the dataset. For the Titanic dataset, this would be (714, 7), meaning 714 rows and 7 columns.
# 
# df.describe():
# 
# By default, df.describe() analyzes only numerical columns. For the Titanic dataset, the numerical columns are age, fare, and sibsp, parch, so df.describe() will only provide summary statistics for these columns.
# If you have non-numeric columns like pclass, sex, embarked, etc., these will not appear in the default df.describe() output.
# 
# df.describe(include='all'):
# 
# This includes summaries for all columns, both numeric and non-numeric. It will show count, unique values, top occurrences, and frequency for categorical columns and the same statistics as before for numeric columns.

# Values Reported in the "Count" Column:
# 
# df.shape:
# 
# The count of rows is straightforward: it is 714 in this case.
# 
# df.describe():
# 
# For numerical columns, the count reflects the number of non-null values in each column. If some entries are missing in columns like age or fare, the count will be less than 714 for those columns.
# For example, if there are missing values in the age column, the count for age might be less than 714.
# 
# df.describe(include='all'):
# 
# For non-numeric columns, it will show the number of non-null entries. Missing values in categorical columns will also be reflected in this summary.

# Example Output Analysis

# Assuming the following:
# 
# df.shape gives (714, 7).
# df.describe() might show a count of, say, 714 for fare, but less for age if there are missing values.
# df.describe(include='all') will provide the count for all columns, including categorical columns, showing any missing values for these as well.

# Conclusion
# df.shape provides a complete picture of the dataset’s structure.
# df.describe() provides statistics only for numeric columns by default, reflecting the count of non-null values.
# df.describe(include='all') includes all columns and provides a more comprehensive summary, including counts of non-null values for both numeric and categorical columns.

# ## 5. Use your ChatBot session to help understand the difference between the following and then provide your own paraphrasing summarization of that difference
# an "attribute", such as df.shape which does not end with ()
# and a "method", such as df.describe() which does end with ()

# My explanation is that df.shape does not perform operations, but only tells the dataframe information and attributes, such as the number of rows, columns, and size. This is the role of attributes. df.describe() can modify and calculate data and can be used to operate data, which is a method.

# # Summary of Interaction
# 
# 1. Dataset Analysis:
# 
# We discussed how to load and examine the Titanic dataset to understand its structure and content.
# df.shape provides the total number of rows and columns in the dataset, showing its overall size and structure.
# df.describe() provides summary statistics for numerical columns, including metrics like mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values.
# Using df.describe(include='all') includes all columns in the summary, providing counts, unique values, and other statistics for both numerical and categorical data.
# 
# 2. Discrepancies Explained:
# 
# df.shape reflects the complete dimensions of the DataFrame, including all rows and columns.
# df.describe() focuses on numerical columns and reports statistics based on non-null entries, which can be fewer than the total row count if there are missing values.
# df.describe(include='all') offers a comprehensive summary of all columns, detailing both numeric and categorical data.
# 
# 3. Definitions:
# 
# Observations:
# Observations are each row in the dataset, representing an individual record or data point.
# In the Titanic dataset, each observation corresponds to one passenger.
# Variables:
# Variables are each column in the dataset, representing different types of data or attributes measured for each observation.
# For example, variables in the Titanic dataset include age, fare, and sex.
# 
# 4. Understanding Attributes and Methods:
# 
# Attributes:
# An attribute, such as df.shape, does not perform operations. It simply provides information about the DataFrame, like the number of rows and columns.
# Methods:
# A method, such as df.describe(), performs operations on the data, such as calculating statistics. Methods are functions that operate on the object and often modify or analyze the data.
# 
# 5. Your Understanding:
# 
# You accurately summarized that:
# An observation is each row in the dataset, representing an individual record.
# A variable is each column, representing different types of data.
# Attributes provide information without performing operations, while methods perform calculations or actions on the data.

# ## 6. The df.describe() method provides the 'count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', and 'max' summary statistics for each variable it analyzes. Give the definitions (perhaps using help from the ChatBot if needed) of each of these summary statistics

# Count:
# The number of non-missing values in the column. It tells you how many data points are available for each variable.
# 
# Mean: 
# The average value of the data points in the column. It’s calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.
# 
# Std (Standard Deviation):
# A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of the data points from the mean. A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range, while a low standard deviation indicates they are closer to the mean.
# 
# Min:
# The smallest value in the column. It represents the lower bound of the data.
# 
# 25% (First Quartile or Q1):
# The value below which 25% of the data points fall. It’s the first quartile in the distribution.
# 
# 50% (Median or Second Quartile):
# The middle value of the data points when they are sorted in ascending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.
# 
# 75% (Third Quartile or Q3):
# The value below which 75% of the data points fall. It’s the third quartile in the distribution.
# 
# Max:
# The largest value in the column. It represents the upper bound of the data.

# ## 7. Missing data can be considered "across rows" or "down columns". Consider how df.dropna() or del df['col'] should be applied to most efficiently use the available non-missing data in your dataset and briefly answer the following questions in your own words

# ### 1 Provide an example of a "use case" in which using df.dropna() might be peferred over using del df['col']

# Let us use the dataset about characters from animal crossings (from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv) as an example

# From the missing values result, we know that:
# 
# The id column has 1 missing value.
# The song column has 11 missing values.

# Using df.dropna()
# When to Use:
# 
# When missing values are limited to a small number of rows. If we have only a few missing values in some columns and the rest of the data is complete and useful, we might prefer to drop the rows with missing values to avoid losing entire columns.

# Example Code：

# In[3]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset from the URL
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[32]:


# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# In[33]:


# Drop rows with any missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Check for missing values after cleaning
missing_values_after = df_cleaned.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values after cleaning:")
print(missing_values_after)


# ### 2 Provide an example of "the opposite use case" in which using del df['col'] might be preferred over using df.dropna()

# Using del df['col']
# When to Use:
# 
# When a specific column has a significant number of missing values and is not crucial for your analysis. Removing a column may be appropriate if it contains mostly missing values or if its content is not essential.

# Example Code：

# In[17]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset from the URL
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[18]:


# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# In[19]:


# Drop the 'song' column due to significant missing values
del df['song']


# In[20]:


# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# ### 3 Discuss why applying del df['col'] before df.dropna() when both are used together could be important

# It is important to run del df['col'] before running df.dropna() because it simplifies data cleaning, improves processing efficiency, avoids unnecessary deletions, and keeps the focus on related data.

# ### 4 Remove all missing data from one of the datasets you're considering using some combination of del df['col'] and/or df.dropna() and give a justification for your approach, including a "before and after" report of the results of your approach for your dataset.
# 

# Steps and Justification

# Initial Missing Values Analysis:

# In[20]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv")

# Check for missing values
missing_values_before = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values before cleaning:")
print(missing_values_before)


# Remove Columns with Significant Missing Values:

# In[21]:


# Drop the 'song' column
if 'song' in df.columns:
    del df['song']


# Remove Rows with Missing Values:

# In[22]:


# Drop rows with any missing values
df_cleaned = df.dropna()

# Check for missing values after cleaning
missing_values_after = df_cleaned.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values after cleaning:")
print(missing_values_after)


# "Before and After" Report

# Before Cleaning:

# In[23]:


print("Missing values before cleaning:")
print(missing_values_before)


# After Cleaning:

# In[25]:


print("Missing values after cleaning:")
print(missing_values_after)


# # 8. Give brief explanations in your own words for any requested answers to the questions below

# ### 1 Use your ChatBot session to understand what df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() does and then demonstrate and explain this using a different example from the "titanic" data set other than what the ChatBot automatically provide for you

# In[26]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[27]:


# Group by 'class' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby("class")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# df.groupby("class"): This groups the DataFrame by the unique values in the class column. Each group will correspond to a different class category (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
# 
# ["age"]: This selects the age column from each group.
# 
# .describe(): This calculates summary statistics for the age column within each group, which includes count, mean, standard deviation, min, quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%), and max.

# ### 2 Assuming you've not yet removed missing values in the manner of question "7" above, df.describe() would have different values in the count value for different data columns depending on the missingness present in the original data. Why do these capture something fundamentally different from the values in the count that result from doing something like df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe()?

# So df.describe() provides a broad view of each column’s statistics, while df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() offers a detailed look at how statistics for a column vary across different groups，this is the reason why the values provided by df.describe() and df.groupby("col1")["col2"].describe() are different 

# ### 3 Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT

# #### A Forget to include import pandas as pd in your code

# In[1]:


# Define the URL for the dataset
url = 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data'

# Define column names for the dataset
columns = [
    'age', 'workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education-num', 'marital-status',
    'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss',
    'hours-per-week', 'native-country', 'income'
]

# Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=columns, na_values=' ?', skipinitialspace=True)

# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()

# Print the count of missing values for each column
print(missing_values)

# Optionally, print the first few rows of the dataframe to understand its structure
print(df.head())


# Chatbot: It looks like you're encountering a NameError because the pd (Pandas) module hasn't been imported in your code. To fix this, you need to import the Pandas library at the beginning of your script. Here’s how you can correct the code:

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd  # Import Pandas library

# Define the URL for the dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-05-05/villagers.csv"

# Define the column names (optional if the dataset already includes headers)
columns = [
    'age', 'workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education-num', 'marital-status',
    'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital-gain', 'capital-loss',
    'hours-per-week', 'native-country', 'income'
]

# Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(url, header=None, names=columns, na_values=' ?', skipinitialspace=True)

# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing values in each column:")
print(missing_values)


# It can be seen that using chatbot can fix problems encountered in running code more quickly

# #### B Mistype "titanic.csv" as "titanics.csv"

# In[3]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanics.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# Chat bot: It looks like there might be an issue with the URL or the dataset you are trying to load. The correct URL for the Titanic dataset should be:
# 
# "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"

# In[4]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset to confirm successful loading
print(df.head())


# #### C Try to use a dataframe before it's been assigned into the variable

# In[5]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[6]:


# Group by 'class' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = DF.groupby("class")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# Chat bot:The NameError indicates that DF is not defined. This error occurs because you used DF instead of df in your code. Python is case-sensitive, so variable names must match exactly.

# In[7]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Group by 'class' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby("class")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# #### D Forget one of the parentheses somewhere the code

# In[8]:


# View the first few rows of the dataset
sample_data = df.head()
print("Sample data from the dataset:"
print(sample_data


# Chat bot:
# It looks like there’s a small syntax error in your code. Specifically, there’s a missing closing parenthesis in the print statement. Here’s the corrected version:

# In[9]:


# View the first few rows of the dataset
sample_data = df.head()
print("Sample data from the dataset:")
print(sample_data)


# #### E Mistype one of the names of the chained functions with the code

# In[10]:


df.group_by("col1")["col2"].describe()


# Chat bot:The AttributeError indicates that you tried to use df.group_by(), but the correct method is df.groupby(). The groupby method is used to group data based on one or more columns, and then you can apply aggregate functions or perform further analysis on these groups.
# 
# Here’s how you should correct your code:

# In[11]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Correct method to group by and describe
group_by_class = df.groupby("class")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# #### F Use a column name that's not in your data for the groupby and column selection

# In[13]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[14]:


# Group by 'class' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby("Class")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# Chat bot:It looks like the issue might be with column names in the Titanic dataset. In the Titanic dataset from Seaborn, the column names are typically pclass (not Class) and age (which should be correctly referenced).
# 
# Here’s how you can adjust the code to match the column names in the Titanic dataset:

# In[15]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Group by 'pclass' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby("pclass")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# #### G Forget to put the column name as a string in quotes for the groupby and column selection, and see if the ChatBot and google are still as helpful as they were for the previous question

# In[16]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)


# In[18]:


# Group by 'class' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby(class)["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# Chat bot:The SyntaxError you’re encountering is due to incorrect syntax in your groupby statement. Specifically, the column name should be in quotes as a string. Here’s the corrected code:

# In[19]:


import pandas as pd

# Load the Titanic dataset
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/titanic.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Group by 'pclass' and describe the 'age' column
group_by_class = df.groupby("pclass")["age"].describe()
print(group_by_class)


# ## From the examples listed, we can see that chatbot can easily solve most of the problems we encounter in programming without giving more operations, while using Google search is often more time-consuming, requires too many adjustments and may not necessarily solve our problems.

# # 9. Have you reviewed the course wiki-textbook and interacted with a ChatBot (or, if that wasn't sufficient, real people in the course piazza discussion board or TA office hours) to help you understand all the material in the tutorial and lecture that you didn't quite follow when you first saw it?

# Not yet.

# # Summary
# 
# Initial Issue:
# 
# You encountered an error because the Pandas library (pd) was not imported.
# 
# Data Loading:
# 
# There was an issue with loading the Titanic dataset due to using an incorrect variable name (DF instead of df). We corrected the code to use the right variable name and URL.
# 
# Handling Missing Values:
# 
# We discussed how to identify and handle missing values in a dataset. You considered using methods like df.dropna() to remove rows with missing values or del df['col'] to delete columns with missing data.
# 
# Grouping and Describing Data:
# 
# You attempted to group the data by a column and describe another column but encountered errors. The errors were due to incorrect method names and column names. We clarified the correct method to use and emphasized the importance of using exact column names.
# 
# Correct Method:
# 
# The correct approach involves using df.groupby() to group data and then applying the describe() method to get summary statistics. It's essential to use the correct column names and ensure they are in quotes.
# 
# Column Name Verification:
# 
# If you encounter errors related to column names, you should verify the exact column names in the DataFrame.
